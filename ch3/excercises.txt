Chapter 3: Simple Operations with Text
3.4 Top-level versus local definitions
Scope
1. Yes, y is in scope of x
2. No, h is not in scope for g
3. No, d is local to area and is therefore out of scope of r.
4. Yes, now r and d are both in scope for area.

3.5 Types of concatenation functions
Syntax Errors
1. This will not compile. We are using ++ as a prefix function without wrapping it in parens which will give a compiler error. To make this work you would write (++) [1,2,3] [4,5,6]
2. This will not compile. When you use single quotes you are defining a single character but here we have multiple characters meaning we have a String. Strings must be specified with double quotes.
3. This will compile.
